# How to run

## Via IDE

Load the solution into IDE, and use 'Http' run configuration from launchSettings.json (should be loaded automatically). After that, go to `http://localhost:9091/swagger/index.html`.

## Published self-contained version

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/btwotwo/gltx-test-assignment/releases) and download the most recent archive with artifacts. After unpacking, run `CountryGwpApi.exe`, then go to `http://localhost:9091/swagger/index.html`.
